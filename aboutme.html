     <P>I'm currently in the process of t<iframe width="640px" height="480px" src="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=SjyUWVNiDU2KmP71AwPTS6k33WIoWetCrKBE0Iv9AV9UM1c5RUFNOTVFN0tCVzczV0xIVzBRM0NIWS4u&embed=true" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" style="border: none; max-width:100%; max-height:100vh" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen> </iframe>ying to learn ASL. I believe that being able to understand sign language would be a big help in the real world for many deaf people. It's not really taught and schools and I believe it should be because were not always gonna meet a person who has the same capabilities as us hearing people. So with doing this, I believe that trying to learn it would make me feel like I'm doing something better for myself and others. A way that I'm working toward my goals is by downloading free ASL learning apps and watching helpful YouTube videos to learn the basics of sign language. To where it can eventually lead to me signing full sentences to others. Things that I value is being helpful, generous, and considerate to everyone around us who may need that assistance. My short term goal that I wish to accomplish is learning the basic greetings and being able to have at least a conversation with one another. Some characteristics that I am willing to be know as is kind, helpful, sympathetic, thoughtful, and supportive person who really cares about others and willing to help when a person is in need.</P>
